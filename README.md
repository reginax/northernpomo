# Linguistics 154 Project: Online Learning for Northern Pomo
## Overview
This repository contains pages created with the template (at
http://eddersko.github.io/web-template/) with new material aimed at vocabulary and grammar development for learners of the Northern Pomo language based in Mendocino County, California. The website can be accessed at reginax.github.io/northernpomo

## Goals 
The main reason that I am motivated to make efforts for language revitalization for this speech
community is due to the urgency for reviving this dormant language and ensuring that the
documentation efforts since the 1980s are made accessible and repurposed into learning
materials for those seeking to learn about or revive Northern Pomo culture and language. My specific project goals are to:
- provide accessible tools and resources for first-time learners of Northern Pomo
- contribute to digitization efforts of documentation materials
- add missing components of teaching methodology like assessments

## Content 
The reason that I consider this project to be appropriate for this language situation is how this is
a way to add accessible learning materials transformed from academic documentation. Since
there are no more native speakers, the main connection to the language is from written work by
linguists and the more recent efforts to digitize these materials. For anyone with an ancestral
connection to or academic interest in learning Northern Pomo, the main entry way is thus
technology that is both accessible and accommodating to different knowledge levels.

The conceptual content of my project is: two web pages that feature vocabulary list and
comprehension-check components requiring the user to match audio recordings to gloss
Other rich linguistic content includes information on phonology and morphology, verbs and TAM, and other grammatical
content that are referenced from Catherine O’Connor’s Topics on Northern Pomo
Grammar.
### Models & Methodologies 
The main models and methodologies that I am using to develop this project
are
1. Communication-Based Language Instruction or CBI’s 5-step lesson plan helped me
determine what is missing from the current website. Specifically, the steps are setting the
stage with motivators or lesson previews, which could be mapped to the “Overview”
page. Then there is comprehensible input or vocabulary learned through repetition and
hearing, to which I find the current “Lessons and Flashcards” page conductive. Third is
guided practice via activities, and this being so open-ended prompted me to find ways to
use games in addition to the existing flashcards that could reinforce concepts and help
with memorization. Fourth is independent practice where students generate the language,
and for this, a list of corresponding words to audio solutions would be useful. Lastly are
assessments, which I will add in the form of MCQ since they don’t yet exist on the
website.
2. Hinton’s guideline for comprehension before production to determine what area to focus
on -- I chose the former. Also, the models for planning lessons reinforced the importance
of a review component for each lesson.
